@echo off
REM ===========================================================================
REM  Start the local-llm stack: the model server, the API, and the dashboard.
REM
REM    Start-Dashboard.cmd          development - LIVE RELOAD on both halves
REM    Start-Dashboard.cmd prod     production  - faster, no reload
REM
REM  Development is the default because this is a tool you work on, and the
REM  earlier version of this script only ever ran production builds. That is
REM  why editing a component appeared to do nothing until the whole thing was
REM  rebuilt and restarted by hand: `next start` serves a compiled bundle and
REM  has no file watcher at all.
REM
REM  What "live reload" means on each side:
REM
REM    Dashboard  `next dev` enables Fast Refresh. Saving a .tsx re-renders the
REM               changed component in place, usually keeping component state,
REM               so a panel you are watching does not reset.
REM
REM    API        `uvicorn --reload` watches the Python source and restarts the
REM               server when it changes. State is NOT preserved - it is a
REM               process restart - but the browser reconnects on its own,
REM               because the dashboard's event stream retries automatically.
REM
REM  The trade is speed: `next dev` compiles each route on first request, so the
REM  first page load is noticeably slower and pages are not pre-optimised. Use
REM  `prod` when you want to see real performance rather than edit the code.

cd /d "%TOOLKIT%"
REM `start "title" /min` launches this in its own minimised window so the script
REM can continue. Without it the API would block here and the dashboard would
REM never start.
REM
REM --reload-dir limits the watcher to the package source. Pointed at the whole
REM working directory it would also watch .local-llm-data, where the live
REM progress files are rewritten several times a second during a generation -
REM so the API would restart continuously while the model was working.

REM The dashboard's first request fires as soon as the page loads, so give the
