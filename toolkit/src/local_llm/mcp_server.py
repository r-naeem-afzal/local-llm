"""MCP server — lets Claude call the local model directly.

This is the Claude-facing side of the whole arrangement. Claude decides *what* needs
doing; these tools do the reading, extracting and ranking on the local GPU, so that work
costs no plan usage at all.

Replaces a hand-rolled JavaScript bridge that spoke the protocol by hand over stdin. That
worked, but it duplicated the client, the store and the page fetcher in a second language,
so every fix had to be made twice. This version is a thin wrapper over the same `Toolkit`
everything else uses, which means MCP calls land in the same database and show up in the
same dashboard as any other call.

Run it directly, or register it in `.mcp.json`:

    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "local-llm": {
          "command": "python",
          "args": ["-m", "local_llm.mcp_server"]
        }
      }
    }

## Why stdio, and what that means for printing

The transport is stdio: the client launches this as a subprocess and speaks JSON-RPC over
its standard input and output. That has one consequence worth stating plainly, because it
is the most common way to break an MCP server: **anything written to stdout is protocol
traffic.** A stray `print()` corrupts the stream and the client drops the connection with
a parse error that names no cause. Diagnostics must go to stderr, which the client shows
as server logs.
